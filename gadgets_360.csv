Election experts had estimated it could cost $4 billion (roughly Rs. 29,335 crores) to make all the changes, but Senate Republicans never acted on a relief bill from the Democratic-controlled House that included $3.6 billion (roughly Rs. 26,401 crores) to help voting officials.Zuckerberg and Chan stepped into the gap initially in September, with a $300 million (roughly Rs. 2,200 crores) donation. That came after other donors had already been contributing to the nonprofit that is receiving most of the Facebook founder's contributions, the Chicago-based Center for Technology and Civic Life.Facebook Bans Anti-Vaccination Advertisements but Not Antivax Posts“We've seen massive interest in the COVID-19 Response Grant program over the last month from over 2,100 election officials who are seeking funding to ensure safe, health election options for voters in every corner of the country,” said Tiana Epps-Johnson, executive director of the Center for Technology and Civic Life.The money will pay for protective equipment to prevent spread of the coronavirus at polling sites, drive-thru voting locations, equipment to process mail ballots and more.The CTCL is respected by election administrators in both parties. But it was founded by former staffers of a Democratic technology firm, and late last week Louisiana's Republican Attorney General, Jeff Landry, moved to block 26 offices in his state from taking $7.8 million (roughly Rs. 57 crores) in funds. Landry is also working on rewriting state law to bar such arrangements in the future.Facebook to Ban Content That Denies or Distorts the HolocaustA Republican legal group late last week also announced it has filed lawsuits in nine swing states, including Iowa and Pennsylvania, against the donations.Phill Kline of the Thomas More Society's Amistad Project in a statement last week announcing the litigation called the donations “an insidious, coordinated, and stealth campaign to manipulate this year's elections.”Zuckerberg, in a post on Facebook, acknowledged the controversy. “Since our initial donation, there have been multiple lawsuits filed in an attempt to block these funds from being used, based on claims that the organisations receiving donations have a partisan agenda,” Zuckerberg wrote. “That's false. These funds will serve communities throughout the country, urban, rural and suburban, and are being allocated by non-partisan organisations.”Facebook Bars Deceptive Campaign From Pro-Trump GroupZuckerberg added that most election offices that applied have fewer than 25,000 registered voters in their jurisdictions. Some conservatives have criticised CTCL for donating to election offices in large Democratic-leaning cities in swing states. In a widely circulated video from President Donald Trump's campaign, a campaign worker being expelled from an election office in Philadelphia, the recipient of an $8 million (roughly Rs. 58 crores) CTCL election grant, asks if it's not a public place “because it's being funded by the nonprofit?”Zuckerberg added: “I agree with those who say that government should have provided these funds, not private citizens. I hope that for future elections the government provides adequate funding. But absent that funding, I think it's critical that this urgent need is met.”Mi TV Stick vs Fire TV Stick Lite vs Mi Box 4K vs Fire TV Stick 4K: Which is the best budget streaming device for TVs in India?

HBO has announced that His Dark Materials season 2, based on the second book “The Subtle Knife” in Philip Pullman's eponymous trilogy, will premiere November 16 at 9pm ET on HBO and HBO Max in the US. With most HBO shows available immediately after they finish airing and US daylight savings coming to an end at the start of November, that means His Dark Materials season 2 will begin airing November 17 around 8:30am IST on Disney+ Hotstar in India.There's no word on when His Dark Materials season 2 will debut in the UK. The show is a BBC-HBO co-production and the first season aired a day prior — every Sunday — on BBC One in the UK. On the face of it, it looks like that pattern will continue with the second season, given November 16 is a Monday. That would suggest His Dark Materials season 2 should premiere November 15 on BBC One in the UK, though there's no official confirmation on that front as yet.#NewWorldsAwait
Season 2 begins November 16 on @HBOMax. pic.twitter.com/hs9Rcvx6C5— His Dark Materials (@daemonsanddust) October 12, 2020The Comic-Con@Home trailer for His Dark Materials season 2 revealed that Lyra Belacqua / Lyra Silvertongue (Dafne Keen) would find herself in a new world thanks to the actions of Lord Asriel (James McAvoy). There, in the city of Cittàgazze, she meets Will Parry (Amir Wilson), who reveals that he's from a different world, just as Lyra. They must battle constant obstacles and a brewing war to achieve their quest: reunite Will with his father.The “knife” that the book title — “The Subtle Knife” — mentions was also spotted in the first His Dark Materials season 2 trailer, in the hands of John Parry / Stanislaus Grumman (Andrew Scott), who said that it can “cut between worlds”. New characters on season 2 include Dr. Mary Malone (Simone Kirby, from Peaky Blinders) who researches dark matter at Oxford University, witch queen Ruta Skadi (Jade Anouka, from Turn Up Charlie), and knife owner Giacomo Paradisi (Terence Stamp) who lives in Cittàgazze's Torre de Angeli (Tower of the Angels).Review: His Dark Materials Is an Improved Second Attempt, but It’s Not EnoughJane Tranter, executive producer on His Dark Materials via the banner Bad Wolf, told Deadline that writer Jack Thorne and Co. have begun working on His Dark Materials season 3, though BBC and HBO have yet to officially renew the show. Tranter also said that the team is interested in splitting the “huge, sprawling” third and final book, “The Amber Spyglass”, into two seasons. If the studios agree, that would mean a four-season run in total.His Dark Materials season 2 will premiere November 15 (expectedly) on BBC One in the UK, November 16 on HBO and HBO Max in the US, and November 17 on Disney+ Hotstar in India."

Twitter also said it would label tweets that falsely claim a win for any candidate.The company announced several temporary steps to slow amplification of content: for example, from Oct. 20 to at least the end of the U.S. election week, global users pressing ""retweet"" will be directed first to the ""quote tweet"" button to encourage people to add their own commentary.Facebook, Twitter Take Action Over Trump's Misleading COVID-19 PostsIt will also stop surfacing trending topics without added context, and will stop people seeing ""liked by"" recommendations from people they do not know in their timeline.Twitter's decision to hit the brakes on automated recommendations contrasts with the approach at Facebook, which is amping up promotion of its groups product despite concerns about extremism in those spaces.Social media companies are under pressure to combat election-related misinformation and prepare for the possibility of violence or poll place intimidation around the Nov. 3 vote.Twitter Bans Trump Death Wishes, Sparks DebateReuters has reported that Republicans are mobilizing thousands of volunteers to watch early voting sites and ballot drop boxes to find evidence to back up Trump's unsubstantiated complaints about widespread voter fraud.On Wednesday, Facebook said it would ban calls for poll watching using ""militarized language.""© Thomson Reuters 2020Should the government explain why Chinese apps were banned?

US President Donald Trump's administration has ordered TikTok's Chinese parent ByteDance to divest the app, citing concerns that the data of US citizens could be accessible to China's Communist Party government. TikTok has sued the US government to stave off a ban from US app stores while deal negotiations continue.Triller, which was launched in 2015 and only has a fraction of the 100 million users that TikTok boasts in the United States, has said it hopes that the uncertainty over its rival's future will drive more influencers and users to its platform.TikTok Sued by Rival Triller for Patent InfringementTriller is working with investment bank Farvahar Partners as it negotiates a potential deal with a so-called special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC), the sources said. A SPAC is a shell company that raises money in an initial public offering (IPO) to merge with a privately held company which then becomes publicly traded as a result.Triller's SPAC negotiations are happening alongside discussions with investors about a private fundraising round, led by investment bank UBS Group AG, in which the Los Angeles-based company is seeking to raise around $250 million (roughly Rs. 1,828 crores), the sources said.Triller has so far secured around $100 million (roughly Rs. 731 crores) in that round at a $1.25 billion (roughly Rs. 9,140 crores) valuation, according to the sources. It is deliberating whether to proceed with the private fundraising or opt for the deal with a SPAC, one of the sources added.TikTok Banned in Pakistan Over The sources cautioned that no deal is certain and asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.Farvahar Partners and UBS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.SPACs have emerged as a popular IPO alternative for companies this year, providing a path to going public with less regulatory scrutiny and more certainty over the valuation that will be attained and funds that will be raised. US SPACs have raised $53.8 billion (roughly Rs. 3,93,412 crores) so far in 2020 through IPOs, more than the total raised in the prior seven years, according to industry tracker SPAC Research.TikTok Ban: US Appeals Judge's Ruling That Blocked DownloadsTriller said earlier this year it had 65 million monthly active users on its short video app, although many analytics companies have said they have not been provided enough access to independently verify Triller's figures.Triller's celebrity users include musicians Alicia Keys, Cardi B and Eminem, and its financial backers include Kendrick Lamar and The Weeknd.Triller is owned by media industry veteran Ryan Kavanaugh and healthcare executive Bobby Sarnevesht. Kavanaugh in 2004 founded US film studio Relativity Media, whose films included the award-winning The Fighter. The studio ended up filing for bankruptcy twice, in 2015 and 2018.Sarnevesht was a partner at Bay Area Surgical Management, which lost a $37.4 million (roughly Rs. 273 crores) legal battle against Aetna after the health insurance firm alleged in 2012 that it had been defrauded by the surgery centers operator.Bid for TikTokTriller sued TikTok in July, alleging it infringed its patent for stitching together multiple music videos with a single audio track.In August, Triller said it had partnered with investment firm Centricus Asset Management in a bid for TikTok. ByteDance, however, said it was not engaged in such discussions.Trump last month said he had given his preliminary blessing to a deal that would give a 20 percent stake in TikTok to computer networking conglomerate Oracle and retail giant Walmart. The negotiations subsequently stalled, as ByteDance maintained it would keep an 80 percent stake in TikTok, rather than distribute it to its investors.TikTok is widely popular with US teenagers, though its advertising business is still nascent. Major companies, including Procter & Gamble, Danone and Chipotle Mexican Grill told Reuters last week they would keep spending on advertising with TikTok despite the uncertainty over its future.© Thomson Reuters 2020Flipkart, Amazon have excellent iPhone 11, Galaxy S20+ sale offers, but will they have enough stock?

The big technology platforms will have to comply with tougher regulation than smaller competitors, says the report, citing people familiar with the discussions. New rules will force the companies to share data with rivals and be more transparent on how they gather information, the report said.The list will be made based on parameters like market share and number of users, the report said, adding that the exact number of companies and the precise criteria for the list was still being discussed.The EU is preparing to force big technology companies to share their customer data with smaller rivals, the publication had noted in another report published on September 30, citing an early draft of the 'Digital Services Act' regulations.Google Poised to Strike Deal to Pay French Publishers for Their NewsThe draft suggests that technology giants may be banned from preferential treatment of their own services on their sites or platforms, to the detriment of rivals. The report had said that companies should not be allowed to pre-install their own applications on hardware devices, such as laptops or phones, or force other companies to exclusively pre-install their software.When reached out for comments by Reuters, Goole had pointed to a blog post it had published in late September, which details its response to the draft regulations.""The question is not whether data mobility or data access should be facilitated, but how to achieve their benefits without sacrificing product quality or innovation incentives,"" Google had said in the post.

The Cupertino-based company has teased the event with an invite that reads, “Hi, Speed”, hinting at the 5G capability of the iPhone 12. But a new report has a note of caution for its potential customers in the UK. It says that the iPhone 12 lineup may face coverage issues in the country because it is likely to not have the support for 700MHz 5G band, a lower spectrum band that helps signals cover more ground.The report published late on Saturday in The Telegraph cites “industry insiders” as the source of this crucial information. Simon Rockman, a 5G analyst quoted in the report, estimates that the rollout of 700MHz 5G band in the UK, which is due to be auctioned by Ofcom early next year, will be “quite quick” and could be a missed opportunity for Apple if it releases the iPhone 12 series without 700MHz support.The iPhone 12 lineup is expected to support 5G connectivity across all its models. The most recent leaks and rumours suggest that all iPhone 12 models will have support for sub-6GHz, and only the top-end iPhone 12 Pro Max will also support the faster mmWave 5G.iPhone 12 Lineup Surfaces Ahead of October 13 Launch EventThe mmWave 5G or Millimetre Wave spectrum, the radio frequency spectrum between 24GHz and 100GHz, is said to be extremely fast but its narrow wavelength means a shorter range. It would require telecom companies to set up more cell towers to cover all users. The narrow wavelength also makes mmWave 5G vulnerable to extreme weather. The addition of 700MHz 5G spectrum support to the mix could help fix this problem.The Telegraph report also says that the lack of 700MHz support in the iPhone 12 lineup could unfairly benefit Three, a telecom operator which is said to have acquired large amounts of 5G spectrum.Most of what to expect from the Apple's highly anticipated launch on October 13 seems to have been revealed by a series of leaks. The iPhone 12 family is expected to have four models, starting with the 5.4-inch iPhone 12 mini which is likely to be priced around $699 (roughly Rs. 51,100).5G iPhone Expected to Star at Apple Event© Thomson Reuters 2020Flipkart, Amazon have excellent iPhone 11, Galaxy S20+ sale offers, but will they have enough stock?

Sony Pictures has unveiled a two-minute look at its adaptation of Capcom's best-selling game series, which reunites the Resident Evil husband-wife duo of Milla Jovovich and writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson. The Monster Hunter trailer confirms what we had previously been told — that the film would be a loose take on the video game lore. Jovovich plays the leader of a military team that is thrown into a world filled with monsters, where they must figure out how to survive and then get back home. This sounds a bit like Jumanji, minus the sense of humour.Jovovich's character even hints at events inspired by the end of Jumanji: The Next Level. Deep into the Monster Hunter trailer, she notes: “If we can get into their world, they can get into ours.” They refers to the giant monsters, one of which proceeds to rip apart a jumbo jet with its feet in a matter of seconds. The Monster Hunter trailer is nearly entirely made up of special effects-driven action sequences, and it'll be interesting to see if the film can punch above the levels of Resident Evil, which failed to score more than 37 percent on reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes during its six-movie run.In addition to Jovovich in the lead, Monster Hunter also stars Thai martial artist-actor Tony Jaa (Furious 7), American rapper Clifford “T.I.” Harris, Jr., American actress Meagan Good (Think Like a Man), Mexican singer-actor Diego Boneta (Rock of Ages), Australian actor Josh Helman (X-Men: Days of Future Past), and American rapper Jin Au-Yeung “MC Jin”, and Ron Perlman (Hellboy). Monster Hunter is a production of Sony Pictures-owned Screen Gems, Germany-based Constantin Film (also behind Resident Evil), China's Tencent Pictures, and Japan's Toho (best known for Godzilla).Debuting in 2004 on the PS2, the Monster Hunter franchise has sold over 64 million copies worldwide as of June this year. Five games have been released in total: 2004's Monster Hunter, 2006's Monster Hunter 2, 2009's Monster Hunter Tri, 2013's Monster Hunter 4, and 2018's Monster Hunter: World, with the last of them responsible for expanding its global popularity. A Nintendo Switch-exclusive sixth title, Monster Hunter Rise, is planned for March 2021.

We're confident that that's what makes us successful.""Flipkart to Create 70,000 New Jobs in India Ahead of Festive SeasonIt is not like Amazon, which in July posted the biggest profit in its 26-year history, cannot afford to play the long game.Prime, which in Mexico charges users MXN 99 (roughly Rs. 400) a month or MXN 899 (roughly Rs. 3,100) a year and offers a slew of music, games and original television along with free shipping, ""has been one of the biggest engines of growth that we've had in the country,"" she said.Just in time for Prime Day, Amazon recently opened its first so-called fulfillment centers outside the Mexico City area, one in Guadalajara and another in Monterrey.These massive warehouses boasting inventories of key products will help to speed up shipping to more regions.In Brazil, where Prime costs BRL 9.90 (roughly Rs. 100) a month or BRL 89 (roughly Rs. 1,200) a year, Amazon began offering memberships just a year ago. Since then, it has seen the fastest subscription growth of any Prime market, with members now in 95 percent of municipalities, Amazon said in a statement.Yet, Prime alone may not be enough to boost Amazon's fortunes, said Gene Munster, managing partner of Loup Ventures, pointing out inventory and distribution as two key areas where Amazon needs to improve.""Undoubtedly it's growing,"" he said of the Prime programme. ""But it's not a question about growing, it's about trying to keep pace with MercadoLibre.""That can be a challenge despite the fact that the local champion lacks a membership perks programme on par with Prime. Adding to MercadoLibre's headstart since its 1999 founding, the company has a broad base of sellers and understands the local terrain.Lyana Kahn, founder of Mexican jewelry company LuckyLy, said her sales on Amazon have benefited from Prime's shipping and discount perks for customers.""It's a great platform that gives you the push to reach more customers without a huge investment,"" Kahn said. Even so, LuckyLy also sells its sparkly earrings and gold-plated necklaces on several other sites, including MercadoLibre.""Every platform has something different to offer,"" Kahn said.

The event will take place virtually — just like the September event where the Cupertino-based company unveiled its new smartwatches, iPad models, and a subscription bundle called the Apple One. At today's event, Apple is expected to bring not just one or two but four new iPhone models — all under the iPhone 12 branding — along with 5G support. The company is formally calling the event “Hi, Speed” that is enough to speculate a faster experience through the new iPhone models. You can also expect the usual “one more thing” announcement by the company that could be related to a new HomePod speaker or over-the-ear headphones.Apple event timing, live stream detailsThe much-awaited Apple event will begin at 10am PDT (10:30pm IST) today. Unlike the past iPhone launches, this will be hosted virtually from the Apple Park. It will be streamed live through the dedicated Apple Events site as well as YouTube. Furthermore, you can watch today's Apple event live from the video embedded below.Apple event announcements expectedIf we look at what has so far been churned out by the rumour mill, Apple is launching four new iPhone models at the event that will be called the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max, and the iPhone 12 mini. All new models will have 5G support, though their US versions are said to have antennae for faster, mmWave frequencies. Apart from the new iPhone models, Apple may announce its new HomePod (read the HomePod mini) or over-the-ear headphones at today's event. Initial reports suggested the launch of its AirTags alongside the 2020 iPhone family. However, that plan seems to have been changed.5G iPhone Expected to Star at Apple EventiPhone 12 series price (expected)In terms of pricing, the iPhone 12 mini seems to be the most affordable model in the latest range, with a starting price tag of $699 (roughly Rs. 51,200). The iPhone 12, on the other hand, is likely to start at $799 (roughly Rs. 58,600), while the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max could begin at $999 (roughly Rs. 73,200) and $1,099 (roughly Rs. 80,600), respectively.iPhone 12 specifications (expected)The iPhone 12 family is rumoured to come with OLED Super Retina XDR displays and feature a Ceramic Shield glass cover on top. The new models are also expected to have Apple's A14 Bionic SoC that recently debuted with the new iPad. A post on Weibo suggested that the new iPhone models would support 15W wireless charging that will be officially called MagSafe — the branding that was earlier associated with the technology enabling magnetically attached power connectors of MacBooks.Apple is likely to distinguish the experience across the iPhone 12 models by offering different camera specifications. For instance, the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 are said to have dual rear cameras, while the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max would provide triple rear cameras, with the third camera being a LiDAR sensor. The iPhone 12 Pro Max is also likely to have a unique super-wide-angle camera capability.    iPhone 12 to Offer 5G Speeds US Networks Can’t Deliver: Analysis   iPhone 12 Users May Face 5G Connectivity Issues in the UK: Report   iPhone 12 Will Cost More Than iPhone 11 Due to 5G Support: Report   The iPhone 12 mini is said to have a 5.4-inch display, while the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro would come with a 6.1-inch display. The iPhone 12 Pro Max, on the other hand, may offer a 6.7-inch display. Design-wise, all four models are likely to have the same aesthetics, though there would be some differences on the part of colour options.Are Apple Watch SE, iPad 8th Gen the Perfect ‘Affordable' Products for India?

Kuo also claimed that the inclusion of 5G won't be the primary consideration for consumers while buying. Instead, it will be the price that matters more.In an investor note accessed by Apple Insider, the noted Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that while the compact 5.4-inch iPhone 12 mini will be the cheapest model announced at the Apple launch event, it won't sell as highly, as the screen is too small to appeal to the mass market.iPhone 12 mini is estimated to be priced at $699 (roughly Rs. 51,200). iPhone 12, meanwhile, is likely to start at $799 (roughly Rs. 58,600), iPhone 12 Pro at $999 (roughly Rs. 73,200), and iPhone 12 Pro Max at $1,099 (roughly Rs. 80,600).Apple Event Today: How to Watch iPhone Launch Live StreamKuo also expressed doubts at reports putting iPhone 12 sales at around 80 million.

The company's product marketing manager and global spokesperson Angus Kai Ho Ng has confirmed that a new phone may be in the offing, with a launch expected before the end of 2020. A Poco phone was also spotted on a certification website with the same model number as the Redmi Note 10, indicating a possible rebranding. The company introduced several smartphones this year starting with Poco X2 in February. Poco then launched Poco M2 Pro in July and Poco M2 went official in September. Poco X3 was launched in the same month, whereas the super affordable Poco C3 arrived in October.The executive tweeted that the company is working on something new, to be launched this year. The post reads, “Been quiet for a while.... It's almost near end of the year.... Just want to say. Poco isn't finished with this year yet.” This indicates a new phone in the offing. However, it can also be speculated Poco branches out into a completely different product category and launch a smartwatch or a different IoT product.A new Poco phone was reportedly spotted on Russian certification site EEC recently and it comes with the model number M2010J19CG. The China variant of the same model number is associated with the Redmi Note 10 series, hinting that the upcoming Poco phone may be another Redmi rebrand.The Poco M2 Pro launched earlier this year was trolled heavily for being a rebrand of the Redmi Note 9 Pro. The handset had identical specifications as the Redmi Note 9 Pro, apart from better fast charging support. The EEC certification suggests that Poco may be looking to introduce another rebranded Redmi handset. It remains to be seen whether the company follows the same trend again or not.The upcoming Poco phone could also be a completely different handset that isn't a rebadged Redmi variant, and we expect to get more clarity on this in the near future.Poco M2 Pro: Did we really need a Redmi Note 9 Pro clone?

But the blazing speeds promised will not materialise for most people.The device, dubbed the iPhone 12 by analysts, can tap into 5G, or fifth generation wireless technology, that theoretically operates as much as 10 to 20 times faster than current 4G wireless networks.Using the next iPhone or any 5G enabled device on today's network, however, will be ""like having a Ferrari ... but using it in your local village and you can't drive to up to 200 miles per hour, simply because the roads cannot maintain those speeds,"" explained Boris Metodiev, associate director of research firm Strategy Analytics.Apple Store Online to Offer Free AirPods With iPhone 11 in IndiaApple, which is expected to unveil the new phone at a virtual event on Tuesday, will need to walk a tightrope between enticing consumers to upgrade their phones while not over-promising what 5G can do today.Current 5G US networks mostly use low-band wireless spectrum, or airspace, that is slower than high-band spectrum, but more reliable over longer distances. It will likely take years before the massive speed boost phone carriers promise will make augmented reality and real-time cloud gaming seamless.Several US telecom operators have deployed networks based on lower spectrum bands, with slightly higher speeds than 4G. A noticeably faster variant of ""mid-band"" 5G is also being rolled out, but it is unlikely to reach three-quarters of Americans until 2025, estimated longtime Apple analyst Gene Munster of venture capitalist firm Loup Ventures.iPhone 12 Users May Face 5G Connectivity Issues in the UK: ReportThe fastest speeds touted by carriers are a type of 5G called millimeter Wave, or mmWave, that work over shorter distances. Verizon has the largest current mmWave network, available only in limited areas.Although Verizon 5G users could connect almost 10 times faster than on Sprint and T-Mobile, actual average speeds were far lower, according to research firm OpenSignal's mobile signal experience report in June.On average, AT&T and Verizon customers with 5G phones saw only a small bump up from 4G speeds, according to the same study.iPhone 12 Lineup Surfaces Ahead of October 13 Launch EventIn South Korea and in China, faster 5G networks are more pervasive. But Apple will be competing against local brands including Samsung in South Korea, which is already on its second line of 5G phones, and China's Huawei, whose sales have surged after the telecom giant was banned in the United States.The other big letdown is that applications using higher speeds to deliver something new have yet to be created. It is a chicken and egg problem at this part of the tech cycle, executives said, noting that interest in 4G was fueled by Facebook's mobile apps and Alphabet's YouTube.""The applications we will be dazzled by, that will really take advantage of the network, will only be developed once the network and devices are available,"" said Morgan Kurk, chief technology officer of CommScope, a telecom equipment maker.US consumers most motivated to buy a 5G phone would be those who need a new smartphone right now and are looking to protect their investments.""If you're buying a phone that you're going to have for three years, you're going to want to make sure that it's going to support the latest networks,"" said Geoff Blaber, vice president of research at CCS Insight.Just know what to expect, Blaber added. ""There's going to be relatively little that you can do on a 5G iPhone you can't do on a 4G iPhone today.""© Thomson Reuters 2020Flipkart, Amazon have excellent iPhone 11, Galaxy S20+ sale offers, but will they have enough stock?

The developer has been accused of showing ads that bear little resemblance to the actual gameplay of these two mobile games. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned the advertisements, saying that they were “not representative of the games they were purported to feature”. Both Homescapes and Gardenscapes have more than 100 million downloads on the Google Play store.Homescapes and Gardenscapes have a similar storyline that centres on the need to renovate a home or a garden. But to complete the chores, the user must complete levels and earn the required “stars”. These are won by completing match-three type mini-games – similar to Bejewelled or Candy Crush Saga – that appear within the storyline. But the advertisements purported a much more complex, problem-solving gameplay. They presented the users with right and wrong choices on each move that would help their character escape a trap, rescue another character, or avert a disaster.Playrix in its defence had argued that gameplay shown in its advertisements was, indeed, among the levels in both games, but part of the advanced stages. But the ASA in its ruling, first reported by the BBC, sided with the seven complainants and told the developer that the advertisements should not be used again. According to a Sensor Tower report, both Homescapes and Gardenscapes had crossed $1 billion (roughly Rs. 7,330 crores) in lifetime revenue by November last year.The pop-up advertisements from Playrix were appearing regularly on Instagram and Facebook and as part of in-app promotions on other Android and iOS third-party applications. They have also had a few knockoffs with other developers using “Help her escape” puzzle gameplay advertisements to lure users into downloading games that were very different in experience.Should the government explain why Chinese apps were banned?

Set eight years after Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith and 11 years prior to Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope, the as-yet untitled Obi-Wan Disney+ series takes place during a time in the Skywalker Saga when the Jedi Order is at its weakest. Deborah Chow (The Mandalorian, The High Cost of Living) is attached as director, with Joby Harold (King Arthur: Legend of the Sword) and Hossein Amini (McMafia, Drive) having worked on the scripts.Appearing on BBC's The Graham Norton Show last Friday over a video call, McGregor was asked by Norton to confirm his return to Star Wars and whether it's all about him. He replied: “It's the Obi-Wan Kenobi story, I suppose. Well, it's not all me but it certainly will be a lot of me, which is good! We start shooting it in March of next year.”One of Norton's studio guests then chimed in with a question of their own, about how McGregor is now much closer in age to Alec Guinness, who memorably played Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original Star Wars trilogy, between 1977 and 1983, and was nominated for an Oscar. McGregor took over the role for the Star Wars sequel trilogy, between 1999 and 2005.McGregor said: “I mean the fun thing about doing them in the first place when I was much younger was trying to imagine Alec Guinness, ‘How would he play these scenes as a younger guy?' And it led me to watch a lot of his early work, which I hadn't seen before. Brilliant movies, wonderful films that he'd been in. And I had such a great time sort of studying him in those movies.”He then added: “This time [on the Obi-Wan Disney+ series], as you say, I'm much closer in age to him. And it will be my challenge to try and sort of meet him somewhere. I love Alec Guinness, I never got to meet him, but I love him through his work and it's a great honour to be able to sort of try and pretend to be him.”Originally planned as a standalone movie with a different director, the Obi-Wan prequel was turned into a Disney+ series after the critical and commercial failure of Solo: A Star Wars Story. It was officially announced at Disney's D23 Expo last August, where McGregor also revealed that it would consist of six one-hour episodes. Amini was then attached as writer but he left in January when the series was indefinitely postponed, due to the scripts' alleged similarity to The Mandalorian. Harold replaced him as the writer back in April.

And we're just getting started. #IAC2020 More: https://t.co/8WzV1BfJy3 pic.twitter.com/ZNo90qf3on— Jim Bridenstine (@JimBridenstine) October 13, 2020""With today's signing, we are uniting with our partners to explore the Moon and are establishing vital principles that will create a safe, peaceful, and prosperous future in space for all of humanity to enjoy.""While NASA is leading the Artemis programme, it has emphasised the need for international partnerships in building up a sustainable presence on the Moon, something the agency views as key ahead of an eventual human mission to Mars.NASA Gets New Partners for Artemis ProgrammeThe agency hopes, for example, to excavate ice from the Moon's south pole to supply both drinking water and to split the molecules apart to make rocket fuel for the onward journey.It also plans to establish an orbital space station called Gateway.NASA said the Artemis Accords reinforce and implement the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, and are split broadly into 10 principles.Back to Venus: Upstart Company Wants to Beat NASA in Search for LifeThe signatories commit, for example, to adhering to peaceful exploration in a transparent manner, to create hardware systems that are operable by every member nation, and to registering their space objects.Other principles include affirming that they will render assistance to each other in case of emergency, make their scientific data public, preserve the heritage of outer space and plan for the safe disposal of space debris.The announcement came a day after Dmitry Rogozin, the head of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, said Moscow was unlikely to participate in the Gateway space station, marking the probable end of the type of close cooperation seen for two decades on the International Space Station (ISS).The Artemis Accords also exclude China, a rising space rival to the United States.China has an active lunar program with its own international collaborations. Last month, a Chinese-German team published daily radiation measurements on the lunar surface recorded by the Chang'E 4 lander in 2019.They concluded that the level of radiation limited astronauts to two or three months on the Moon, vital information that the US Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s had not gathered.Mi TV Stick vs Fire TV Stick Lite vs Mi Box 4K vs Fire TV Stick 4K: Which is the best budget streaming device for TVs in India?

Six animated features would mean surpassing Hollywood's biggest studios — including the likes of Disney and Disney-owned Pixar, Sony Pictures Animation, Universal Pictures' DreamWorks Animation and Illumination Entertainment, and Warner Bros. — which usually release two to four animated films a year. It's an ambitious aim, given animated movies tend to be very cost- and time-intensive, one that is bound to come with its own problems.“Our animation ambition right now is not just to step up and be as big as someone who's doing it today — we're on a path to be releasing six animated features a year, which no major studio has ever done, on top of the very healthy slate of animated series,” Sarandos told Variety. “The way we think about those things is not to say, ‘Well, how do we do it like someone else has done it?' Because no one's ever really done most of these functions at the scale that we're doing, and the only way you could do that is to have a really trusted team, who will make decisions and take them seriously and own them.”That is especially ambitious considering Netflix has released less than half a dozen animated films in its history, including the anime sci-fi action Blame! in 2017, traditionally animated Christmas comedy-drama Klaus in 2019, computer-animated black comedy The Willoughbys back in April, anime fantasy A Whisker Away in June, and computer-animated sci-fi comedy Fearless in August. But as you can see, it's been ramping up, with three of those efforts coming in 2020.Netflix’s Quest for World Domination Includes a Diversity in AnimationNetflix has at least three more slated for this year, in computer-animated musical adventure Over the Moon (October 23), animated rom-com You Animal! (October 29), and — its first from India — the hand-painted romantic drama Bombay Rose (TBA 2020). It would seem Netflix will hit the six animated film goal this year itself, but a Cartoon Brew report says it won't happen before 2022, which suggests that Netflix isn't counting anime productions within said target.In trying to do something “no major [American] studio has ever done”, Netflix is again prioritising quantity over quality, as it has previously done with its original (non-animated) film slate. Only one of its previous efforts — Klaus — made some waves in the awards circuit, but it's not a title that many have heard about. For what it's worth, Netflix has animated projects from major creators in the works, including Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio, Richard Linklater's Apollo 10½, Gurinder Chadha's Pashmina, and My Father's Dragon from Oscar-nominated Nora Twomey."

The new development is based on a tokenisation process that Google introduced on the Google Pay app back in September last year. It is aimed to enable secure payments via Google Pay using credit and debit cards. Using the tokenisation process, Google Pay hides sensitive card information and allows users to pay using their bank cards virtually at any offline stores or online marketplace.Unlike traditional card payments in which customers need to swipe their credit or debit cards, the latest update allows Kotak Mahindra Bank customers to use their Visa credit or debit card to make payments virtually via Google Pay. The feature is, however, limited to Android devices with NFC support.Customers need to initially link their Kotak cards to the Google Pay app by going to Payment Methods > Add card after tapping on their profile. They will then be asked to enter details such as their card number, expiry date, and CVV and provide the one-time-password (OTP) they have received on their phone. The sensitive information recorded in the app will be replaced with a token that will be used for processing virtual payments.Digital Payment Frauds Reach a New High in India During PandemicOnce connected, Kotak credit or debit cards can be used through the Google Pay app for making merchant payments at nearby stores using NFC-based Tap and Pay as well as for in-app and e-commerce payments. The linked cards can also be used for making transactions on Google Pay using its scan and pay feature.“Customer convenience, ease-of-use and, most significantly, enhanced security for our customers are the key hallmarks of Kotak's collaboration with Google Pay,” said Shanti Ekambaram, Group President – Consumer Banking, Kotak Mahindra Bank, in a prepared statement. “Now, Kotak customers need not carry their debit or credit cards while going out for shopping or enter sensitive card details for every online transaction, resulting in a smooth and highly secure payment experience for our customers.”    Google Pay Clarifies It Doesn't Share User Data Outside of Payments Flow   Amazon Pay to Sell Google Play Recharge Codes in India   It is important to note that the tokenised card data has been stored locally by Visa.

The new phone lineup is said to include Realme Q2 Pro and Realme Q2, and the latter has been reportedly spotted on Geekbench as well. Realme took to Weibo to share a poster for the launch event, along with the date and time. The company has not shared specifications for the phones, some of which have been tipped by the recent Geekbench listing as well by a known tipster on Twitter.Realme shared a poster on Chinese micro-blogging website Weibo mentioning the launch date as October 13, and the event will start at 10am CST Asia (7:30am IST). The poster does not reveal any specifications for the phones but teases Android 11 out of the box. The phones in the Realme Q2 series are expected to run Realme UI 2.0.A Realme phone with model number RMX2117, believed to be the vanilla Realme Q2, was also spotted on Geekbench, after appearing on TENAA late last month.

The latest policy expands the ban to advertisements that discourage vaccines for any reason.But Facebook also said Tuesday that advertisements that “advocate for or against legislation or government policies around vaccines,” including a COVID-19 vaccine, will still be allowed. These advertisements will still have to be approved by the company as political advertisements and include a “paid for by” label on who is funding them.Facebook to Ban Content That Denies or Distorts the HolocaustUnpaid posts by people or groups that discourage vaccinations will also still be allowed, the new policy only includes paid advertisements.The social network said it will also run an information campaign encouraging people to get their flu shots this year.Facebook has taken other steps to try to stop the spread of vaccine and coronavirus-related misinformation on its platform. Last year, it said it would begin hiding groups and pages that spread misinformation about vaccinations from the search function of its site.Facebook, Twitter Dismantle Global Array of Disinformation NetworksSince the pandemic began, the company has tightened its rules around COVID-related misinformation. For instance, it promotes articles that debunk COVID-19 misinformation, of which there are thousands, on a new information center called “Get The Facts.” It also bans what it deems “dangerous"" misinformation about the virus and has removed posts by President Donald Trump under this policy.Some experts were skeptical about the move.Facebook is addressing the anti-vaxxers of 2014 and 2015 and not the anti-vaxxers of 2020, said David A. Broniatowski, an associate professor at George Washington University's school of engineering and applied science who has published several studies on vaccine misinformation.Facebook Bars Deceptive Campaign From Pro-Trump GroupBroniatowski published a study in 2019 that found that the majority of anti-vaccine misinformation being pushed in advertisements on Facebook were coming from two groups, including one led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and a California-based organisation called Stop Mandatory Vaccination.“Facebook by banning anti-vaccine advertisements is probably not banning more than half of the advertisements,” he said. “I understand where they are coming from that they want to promote civil engagement but at the same time, if their intention is to reduce the amount of anti-vaccine misinformation, they are not addressing the largest source of that misinformation.”Mi TV Stick vs Fire TV Stick Lite vs Mi Box 4K vs Fire TV Stick 4K: Which is the best budget streaming device for TVs in India?

With over 6 billion views, the tag 'iPhone12' ranked as the no. 1 topic on China's Twitter-like Weibo.iPhone 12 Models Are the Cheapest in These CountriesAsked if they'd buy the new iPhone, which will give Apple users 5G access in a market where such networks are already widespread, respondents to a Caijing magazine poll were almost evenly split: some 10,000 voted no, 9,269 said yes, and just over 5,400 said they were still considering it.Available for orders in China from October 16, the iPhone 12 will cost CNY 5,499 (roughly Rs. 60,000) for a 'mini' version, rising to as much as CNY 11,899 (roughly Rs. 1,30,000) for the top of the range.That price tag was also a hot topic, with many complaining it was too expensive. ""How is it this expensive even with no power charger or earbuds?,"" said one commenter, referring to Apple's announcement that it would leave out those components citing environmental reasons.iPhone XR, iPhone SE (2020), iPhone 11 Get Official DiscountMany Weibo users said they may put off ordering iPhone 12s to wait for the expected unveiling of Huawei's rival Mate 40 Pro this month.Still, analysts said they were bullish about the iPhone 12's reception in China, saying that the firm still likely had many loyal users who have postponed upgrading devices until the launch of the 5G-friendly iPhone 12.With the new model in view, research firm Canalys recently revised its forecast for iPhone shipments to China in fourth-quarter 2020 to a 14 percent year-on-year increase, a big swing from the 1 percent decrease it originally predicted.iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max Launched""In China now, 5G is not a premium feature, it's a must-have feature,"" said Nicole Peng, who tracks China's smartphone sector at Canalys. Peng said the 5G launch will ""trigger a new wave of phone replacements"" for Apple in China before the end of the year and in first-quarter 2021.Canalys expects 50 percent of Chinese phone owners to be using a 5G device by the end of 2020, as networks and phone brands have aggressively pushed adoption. Only 29 percent of US phone owners will be on 5G devices by the same time.Apple could also stand to benefit from a potential unravelling of its main high-end rival Huawei, which could see its smartphone division collapse next year due to US restrictions on its supply of chips.Neil Shah, analyst at Counterpoint Research, said he expects Apple stands to benefit ""significantly"" from the potential gap which will be left due to the US trade restrictions on Huawei to produce new phones at scale.On the flipside, there is lingering concern that Apple could be vulnerable to growing geopolitical tensions between the United States and China.Beijing is expected to unveil an 'entity list' that bars domestic companies from doing business with certain foreign companies amid industry speculation that Apple and other high-profile tech firms could be targeted.Throughout the past year though, consumer sentiment has yet to turn negative on Apple, even as Huawei's troubles have made headlines in China.Apple's unit shipments in China increased 35 percent year-on-year in China in the second quarter of 2020, according to Canalys. That made it the only top brand besides Huawei to see positive growth, a feat it achieved even without offering a 5G device.© Thomson Reuters 2020Mi TV Stick vs Fire TV Stick Lite vs Mi Box 4K vs Fire TV Stick 4K: Which is the best budget streaming device for TVs in India?

The lawsuit came after Epic rolled out its own payment system in the popular Fortnite video game.Apple does not allow such alternative payment systems and removed Fortnite from the App Store and threatened to terminate Epic's developer accounts, which would have affected Epic's other business of selling software used to create games.Epic Games Wins Support From Fortnite Gamers, Firms on Apple StandoffEpic moved to stop Apple from taking both steps.

Free and paid users will be able to host up to 200 participants in an end-to-end encryption (E2EE) meeting on the video conferencing platform. Zoom said that the feature will be available initially as a technical preview, so that users can provide feedback to the company for the first 30 days. This is Phase 1 of a four-stage process for the end-to-end encryption rollout. Zoom said it plans to start Phase 2 that will include better identity management and end-to-end encryption with single-sign-on integration, in 2021.Although Zoom has flourished in the pandemic, with more and more users relying on virtual modes of communication, it has also come under criticism for its security practices. End-to-end encryption is an effort to make the platform safer.Earlier, Zoom would generate encryption keys and distribute them to participants. Now, with end-to-end encryption, the meeting's host generates encryption keys and uses public key cryptography to distribute these keys to the other meeting participants. Zoom said, in a blog post, that it still uses the same GCM encryption; the difference was where those encryption keys live.Zoom Adds External Authentication to Make Virtual Classrooms More SecureEnabling end-to-end encryption in Zoom's current version will disable certain features such as join before host, cloud recording, streaming, live transcription, Breakout Rooms, polling, 1:1 private chat, and meeting reactions.In order to verify that the meeting is using end-to-end encryption, users can look for a green shield logo with a padlock in the middle. This will be located in the upper left corner of the meeting screen, and indicates that the meeting is using E2EE. Participants will also be able to see the meeting leader's security code. If the numbers are the same on everyone's screen, this indicates that the Zoom meeting is end-to-end encrypted.Zoom had announced its plans of introducing end-to-end encryption earlier this year for fee-paying users. After receiving heavy backlash for this, Zoom had said that all users will be provided with the ‘highest level of security.' However, free users will have to participate in a one-time verification process before they can use end-to-end encryption.Zoom Opens Platform for Paid Events, Following FacebookHow to use end-to-end encryptionTo user end-to-end encryption, users will be required to enable E2EE meetings at the account level, and opt-in E2EE on a pre-meeting basis. Meeting hosts can enable the setting for end-to-end encryption at the account, group, and user level, and can be locked at the account or group level. To join an E2EE meeting, all participants must have the setting enabled.In the on-going Phase 1 of end-to-end encryption rollout, Zoom said that all meeting participants must join the E2EE meeting from Zoom desktop client, the mobile app, or Zoom Rooms.Flipkart, Amazon have excellent iPhone 11, Galaxy S20+ sale offers, but will they have enough stock?

HBO is reportedly developing a six-episode limited series based on Ashlee Vance's 2015 best-selling Musk biography “Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future.” It will tell the story of a team of SpaceX engineers who were picked by Musk to build and launch a rocket into orbit (Falcon 1), and subsequently delivered the first-ever reusable rocket (Falcon 9) that could land vertically. Channing Tatum is among the executive producers on the HBO SpaceX series, alongside Doug Jung (Star Trek Beyond) as writer and executive producer.Variety brings word of HBO working on a SpaceX miniseries, and notes that Musk is not involved “at this time.” Vance's book covers Musk's life from childhood to his SpaceX days, through his years at city guide Zip2, payments processor PayPal, and electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla. However, the HBO series will only focus on SpaceX that has a lot of firsts to its name for a privately-funded space company, including the first manned Falcon 9 mission back in May.Musk founded SpaceX in 2002, a year before he started Tesla, and now commands a personal net worth of nearly $100 billion (about Rs. 7,34,000 crores).In addition to Star Trek Beyond, Jung has previously worked on the Netflix psychological crime thriller series Mindhunter, the 2018 sci-fi horror film The Cloverfield Paradox, and the action series Banshee, available on Disney+ Hotstar in India. Jung was also the creator on the short-lived TNT action crime drama series Dark Blue.Tatum's Free Association banner will produce the HBO SpaceX series, with Free Association's Reid Carolin and Peter Kiernan also serving as executive producers, alongside former HBO Films president Len Amato and Vance. Free Association's Michael Parets will oversee the HBO SpaceX series.

The listing does not give away any details about the two smartphones and only mentions the model numbers. Samsung Galaxy M02 could also just be a rebranded Galaxy A02 as both model numbers appear in the same listing. Last month, Samsung Galaxy A02 was allegedly spotted in a Geekbench listing that hints at some of the key specifications of the phone.The Nemko AS website listing shows model numbers SM-A025F/DS, SM-A025F, SM-M025F/DS, SM-A025M/DS, and SM-A025M. The SM-A025F models are believed to be Samsung Galaxy A02 while the single SM-M025F model listing is believed to be Samsung Galaxy M02. Since the two model numbers are part of the same listing, it can be speculated that Galaxy A02 will be rebranded as Galaxy M02 for certain regions.Last month, the rumoured Galaxy A02 was reportedly spotted in a Geekbench listing with model number SM-A025F and 2GB of RAM. The listing shows that the phone will be powered by an octa-core Qualcomm SoC, likely the Snapdragon 450. The phone runs Android 10. It posted a single-core benchmarking score of 751 and a multi-core score of 3,824.As Samsung Galaxy A02 is part of the company's ‘0X' series of smartphones, it will most likely be an entry-level phone and may draw some similarities to its predecessor, the Samsung Galaxy A01 that was launched in December last year.

While the Oppo A53s has surfaced on Amazon Germany, specifications and renders of the Oppo A73 5G have been leaked on Twitter. The Oppo A53s is quite similar to the Oppo A53 2020 that was launched in Indonesia in August and debuted in India shortly after its initial launch. The Oppo A73 5G, on the other hand, appears to be a 5G variant of the Oppo A73 that launched last week as a rebranded version of the Oppo F17.Oppo A53s, Oppo A73 5G price (expected)The Amazon Germany website has listed the Oppo A53s with a price tag of EUR 189 (roughly Rs. 16,400). The phone is set to be released in the country on October 13 and is currently available for pre-orders through the online marketplace in the Electric Black and Fancy Blue colour options. Oppo A73 5G price, on the other hand, will start at EUR 299 (roughly Rs. 25,900), as tweeted by tipster Sudhanshu. The phone is said to be available in Black and Neon colours.Oppo A53s specifications (expected)Alongside suggesting the Oppo A53s pricing, the Amazon listing gives some details about its specifications. The listing also includes some renders of the new phone that hint at similarities with the Oppo A53 2020 that was launched in India in August. In terms of specifications, the Oppo A53s features a 6.5-inch 90Hz display, triple rear cameras with a 13-megapixel primary sensor, 128GB of onboard storage, and a 5,000mAh battery with 18W fast charging support. The phone is also powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 SoC. Furthermore, it has 8.4mm of thickness and 186 grams of weight.The listed specifications of the Oppo A53s are also identical to those of the existing Oppo A53. However, since the Amazon listing doesn't provide any details about the RAM, we expect that the new model may debut with at least 8GB of RAM. It is also likely that the new model could be limited to certain European markets.Oppo A73 specifications (expected)The dual-SIM Oppo A73 5G is expected to be the 5G-supporting variant of the Oppo A73 that was launched in Tunisia last week. The phone is said to run on Android 10 with ColorOS 7.2 and feature a 6.5-inch full-HD+ (1,080x2,400 pixels) display with a 90Hz refresh rate. It is also rumoured to have an octa-core MediaTek Dimensity 720 SoC, paired with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of onboard storage. The regular Oppo A73, in contrast, has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 SoC, with 6GB of RAM.Oppo A73 5G is rumoured to have a 6.5-inch full-HD+ display

The Mad Max Furiosa spin-off will be an origin story for its female lead, looking at the years before she teamed up with Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) in Mad Max: Fury Road. George Miller will return to direct, and has also co-written the Furiosa movie with Fury Road co-writer Nico Lathouris.Deadline is among the publications that bring word of Hemsworth and Abdul-Mateen's casting in the Mad Max Furiosa prequel spin-off, and notes that the film is now in “advanced development” at Warner Bros. A draft of the Furiosa script has been ready since before Mad Max: Fury Road released, and Miller had wanted it to film it after Fury Road, but that never materialised due to a legal battle between Warner Bros. and Miller's production company, Kennedy Miller Mitchell, over a $7 million bonus. Back in March, Miller had begun casting over video call, starting with Taylor-Joy.A lot of additional details about the film have also been revealed. Miller is bringing back much of his Mad Max: Fury Road crew for the Furiosa spin-off, Deadline reports. That includes producing partner Doug Mitchell of Kennedy Miller Mitchell; Miller will produce alongside. It also includes production designer Colin Gibson, film editor Margaret Sixel, sound mixer Ben Osmo, and makeup designer Lesley Vanderwalt, all of whom won an Oscar for their work on Mad Max: Fury Road. Also back are first assistant director PJ Voeten and second unit director and stunt coordinator Guy Norris.Hemsworth is of course best known for playing Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He has appeared in eight MCU entries and will reprise his role in Thor: Love and Thunder — currently slated to release in February 2022 — which begins filming in March 2021 in Australia. Hemsworth was last seen in the Netflix action movie Extraction.Abdul-Mateen II recently won an Emmy for his work in the HBO miniseries Watchmen. He has also been involved in the DC film universe, as the villain Black Manta in Aquaman. His other films include Baywatch, The Greatest Showman, and Us. Abdul-Mateen II will be next seen in The Trial of the Chicago 7, out Friday on Netflix. He is currently filming for The Matrix 4, on which he is a lead star.Furiosa is expected to begin filming in 2021."

A few more details about the OnePlus 8T have been tipped ahead of the October 14 event. Separately, OnePlus Founder and CEO Pete Lau tweeted about the OnePlus 8T's dimensions and weight. The new information, clubbed with the phone's previously leaked appearances and its current listing on Amazon, give us a fair idea about what to expect from the OnePlus 8T launch. OnePlus is also reportedly working on a new 10,000mAh powerbank that it might launch soon.OnePlus 8T specifications (confirmed)Starting with the latest, Lau's recent tweet reveals that the OnePlus 8T will be 8.4mm thick and weigh 188g. To give you a comparison, the iPhone 11 that will soon be marked down on Amazon during the Great Indian Festival and come in a bundled offer on the Apple India online store's Diwali offer, is slightly thinner at 8.2mm and weighs 190g. What we also know for sure is that the OnePlus 8T ships with Android 11-based OxygenOS 11, a detail confirmed by Lau in a blog post. OnePlus has also confirmed that its latest flagship will support 5G, come with a 6.55-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, and have Aquamarine Green as one of the colour options. The phone's Amazon listing notes USB Type-C 65W fast charging support as one of its top features. Apart from the phone, OnePlus will also be launching the Buds Z TWS and the Bullets Wireless Z on October 14.OnePlus 8T specifications (expected)The possible camera leak comes from a tweet by tipster Mukul Sharma (@stufflistings). According to Sharma, the OnePlus 8T's quad rear camera setup will have a 48-megapixel Sony IMX586 primary sensor, a 16-megapixel wide-angle shooter, a 5-megapixel macro camera, and a 2-megapixel monochrome sensor. Conspicuous by its absence here is a telephoto lens. The front camera could be a single 16-megapixel Sony IMX471 sensor.OnePlus 8T Virtual Pop-Up Event to Start Right After Launch EventAccording to a previously leaked appearance on Amazon Germany website, OnePlus 8T is likely to have a 4,500mAh battery, come in two 8GB+128GB and 12GB+256GB variants, and have a starting price of EUR 699 (roughly Rs. 60,000). But according to Vietnamese tipster Chun (@chunvn8888), the OnePlus 8T could start at EUR 799 (roughly Rs. 69,000). Gadgets 360 wasn't able to independently verify both the claims.

Meng, the Chinese telecom giant's chief financial officer, was arrested on a US warrant in December 2018 during a stopover in Vancouver.She is charged with bank fraud related to violations of US sanctions against Iran, and has been fighting extradition ever since.Late Thursday, the Canadian justice department announced that British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Heather Holmes had ""upheld a majority of Canada's privilege claims"" related to the documents request.Documents Show Huawei Role in Shipping Prohibited US Gear to IranThe court released the judgment on Friday.Meng's lawyers had sought access to hundreds of documents concerning mostly communications between Canadian and US agencies prior to and after Meng's arrest, arguing that they could contain proof of an alleged conspiracy to collect evidence and interrogate her, in violation of her rights.Specifically, they pointed to her detention and questioning without a lawyer over the three hours after she disembarked a flight from Hong Kong, but before she was charged, as well as the seizure of her electronic devices.If proven, the allegations could result in a stay of the extradition proceedings.Canadian government lawyers had released a slew of documents in recent months, but many were heavily redacted. They denied any plot and claimed solicitor-client and litigation privilege in refusing to hand over more files.After some back and forth, the number of documents sought was whittled down to 19, consisting of mostly emails among or between justice department lawyers and the Canada Border Services Agency.Holmes ruled that only one of them could be released to the defense.The case has added to severe strain in China-US ties and created an unprecedented rift between Canada and China.Nine days after Meng's arrest, China detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor in what is widely viewed as retaliation over Meng.Espionage charges were filed against the pair in June, soon after Meng's first legal setback, when her bid to have the case thrown out -- arguing that the US accusations were not crimes in Canada -- was defeated.Meng remains under house arrest in Vancouver while the extradition case, which is due to wrap up in April 2021, is heard.She is expected to appear in court for the next stage of proceedings on October 26.Should the government explain why Chinese apps were banned?

The ban comes in view of ""complaints from different segments of the society against immoral and indecent content on the video sharing application,"" said the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA).The PTA said it would review its ban subject to a satisfactory mechanism by TikTok to moderate unlawful content. TikTok said it was ""committed to following the law in markets where the app is offered"".""We have been in regular communication with the PTA and continue to work with them. We are hopeful to reach a conclusion that helps us continue to serve the country's vibrant and creative online community,"" it said.TikTok Says a Coordinated Attack Was Behind Recent Suicide Clip UploadsTikTok, owned by China-based ByteDance, has become hugely popular in a short period of time by encouraging young users to post brief videos. But a number of countries have raised security and privacy concerns over its links to China.In June, it was blocked in India - then its largest market by users - which cited national security concerns at a time of a border dispute with China. Separately, it faces the threat of being barred in the United States, and scrutiny in other countries including Australia.TikTok has long denied that its links to China pose a security concern.TikTok Ban: US Appeals Judge's Ruling That Blocked DownloadsAccording to the PTA spokesman, TikTok reported 20 million monthly active users in Pakistan, while it was the third most downloaded app after WhatsApp and Facebook over the last 12 months, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower.Three Pakistani officials had told Reuters earlier on Friday that a ban on the app was imminent. TikTok was issued with a final warning in July. ""We have been asking them repeatedly to put in place an effective mechanism for blocking immoral and indecent content,"" one of the officials directly involved in the decision told Reuters.TikTok, WeChat Bans Break WTO Rules: ChinaMuslim-majority Pakistan has media regulations that adhere to conservative social customs.The decision to ban TikTok was taken after Prime Minister Imran Khan took a keen interest in the issue, said a second official, adding that Khan has directed the telecoms authorities to make all efforts to block vulgar content.Last month, five dating apps, including Tinder and Grindr, were also blocked by the PTA.TikTok to Ban Advertisements That Amplify Body Shaming'TRAVESTY TO DEMOCRATIC NORMS'
